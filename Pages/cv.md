## Briefly About Myself:

Having started my career as a process plant operator. In the process of work, I learned to approach tasks responsibly, to remain calm in various stressful situations, to interact well with people in various teams.

After some time, I began to get involved in the IT sphere and programming in particular. After trying several options, I decided to focus on front-end development. I like to solve interesting problems, learn new opportunities and communicate with people.

  if (n===3) return(1);
  else {
  for (let i = 3; i < n; i++){
    result = n2 + n3;
    n2= n3;
